A short example program showing how to use the Ada Web Server (AWS) library to
add HTTP functionality to your program, specifically showing how to use the
Templates_Parser module to generate content using templates.

To try the program simply run make, navigate to exe/ and start the aws_tutorial
executable:

	$ make
	$ cd exe/
	$ ./aws_tutorial

Enjoy!
